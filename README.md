Blockchain in Python
This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Python. It includes a Block class that represents a block in the chain and a Blockchain class that represents the entire chain.

Getting Started
To use the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the hashlib and json libraries.

How to Use
The Block class has four attributes: index, transactions, timestamp, and previous_hash. The Blockchain class has three attributes: difficulty, unconfirmed_transactions, and chain.

To create a new blockchain, you can use the following code:

Copy code
blockchain = Blockchain()
To add new transactions to the blockchain, you can use the add_new_transaction method:

Copy code
transaction1 = {"sender": "Alice", "receiver": "Bob", "amount": 10}
transaction2 = {"sender": "Bob", "receiver": "Charlie", "amount": 5}
transaction3 = {"sender": "Charlie", "receiver": "Alice", "amount": 15}

blockchain.add_new_transaction(transaction1)
blockchain.add_new_transaction(transaction2)
blockchain.add_new_transaction(transaction3)
To mine a new block, you can use the mine method:

Copy code
last_block_hash = blockchain.mine(difficulty=2)
The mine method will add the pending transactions to the blockchain and find a valid proof of work (also known as mining). The difficulty parameter controls the mining speed.

To check the validity of the blockchain, you can use the is_valid_proof method:

Copy code
blockchain.is_valid_proof(block, block_hash)
This method will check if the block_hash is a valid hash of the block and if it satisfies the difficulty criteria.
